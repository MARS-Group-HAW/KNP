Because of the file size limits we cannot longer provide model box deployments for different architectures. 
Please contact thomas.clemen@haw-hamburg.de in order to receive a download link.

## Run model

Download the deployment from your received link then navigate to the 'KNP Base Model' folder and follow the instructions below:

### Start the simulation

Download and unzip the appropriate archive file suitable for your operating system
To run the KNP elephant scenario, follow the instructions below: 

##### Windows &#10024;
For Windows users, start the box by calling the following command:
```shell script
KrugerNationalParkBox.exe
```
    
##### Unix, Mac, Linux &#10024;

To start the box on UNIX-based systems, execute the following command:

> &#10071;&#10071;&#10071; There may be problems with the verification of the box. Please execute the following command to make them accessible in your terminal:
 ```shell script
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./KrugerNationalParkBox
```
---
As soon as the box starts, it shows you the current parameterization and stops the simulation. 

We added the description of the elephant agent in case you are interested to learn how it works.
More documentation will be added soon. Please contact us if you have questions or found a bug ;-)
